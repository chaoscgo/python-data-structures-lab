# Exercise 0: Example
#
# This is a practice exercise to familiarize you with basic Python data structures.
#
# Create a list called `example_list` and append three elements to it. Print each element using a loop.
#
# Requirements:
# - The list should contain any three elements of your choice.
# - Use a loop to print each element.

def example_list_function():
  example_list = ['element1', 'element2', 'element3']
  for element in example_list:
      print(element)

# Call the function and print each element
example_list_function()


# Exercise 1: List and Indexing
#
# Create a list named students containing at least three student names (strings).
# Assign the second student’s name to a variable named first_student.
# Assign the last student’s name to a variable named last_student.

def manage_students():
    students = ['Ben', 'Jody', 'Andy']
    first_student = students[1]
    last_student = students[2]
    return(first_student, last_student)

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 1:', manage_students())


# Exercise 2: Loop and String Concatenation
#
# Create a tuple named foods containing the same number of foods (strings) as there are names in the students list.
# Create a variable named meal and assign an empty string to it.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the strings in foods and append each string to meal.

def combine_foods():
   foods = ('banana', 'pasta', 'chocolate')
   meal = ""
   for food in foods:
      meal += food
   return(meal)

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 2:', combine_foods())


# Exercise 3: Slicing Tuples
#
# Using the slice operator, assign a new tuple containing only the last two food strings in the foods to a variable named last_two_foods.

def slice_foods():
    foods = ('steak', 'french fries', 'beer')
    last_two_foods = foods[-2:]
    return(last_two_foods)

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 3:', slice_foods())


# Exercise 4: Dictionaries and String Formatting
#
# Create a dictionary named home_town containing the keys of city, state, and population.
# Using the home_town dictionary, assign to a variable named home_town_message a string with this format: “I was born in <city>, <state> - population of <population>”

def hometown_info():
    home_town = {
       'city' :  'Lynchburg',
       'state' : 'Virginia',
       'population' : '14,500'
    }

    home_town_message = (f"I was born in {home_town['city']}, {home_town['state']} - population of {home_town['population']}.")
    return(home_town_message)

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 4:', hometown_info())


# Exercise 5: Iterating Over Dictionary Items
#
# Define an empty list named home_town_items.
# Use a for loop to iterate over the key: value pairs in the home_town dictionary and append a string with the following format to home_town_items: "<key> = <value>"

def list_home_town_items():
    home_town = {
       'city' :  'Lynchburg',
       'state' : 'Virginia',
       'population' : '14,500'
    }

    home_town_items = []

    for key, value in home_town.items():
        home_town_items.extend([f"{key} = {value}"])
    return(home_town_items)

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 5:', list_home_town_items())

# Exercise 6: Celebrate Students
#
# Using the list of students and a list comprehension, assign to a variable named awesome_students a new list containing strings.
# For example: ["Tina is awesome!", "Fred is awesome!", "Wilma is awesome!"]

def create_awesome_students():
    students = ['Ben', 'Jody', 'Andy']
    awesome_students = [f"{student} is awesome!" for student in students]
    return awesome_students

# Call the function and print the result
print('Exercise 6:', create_awesome_students())
